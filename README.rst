Background
----------
`MOOG <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_ was written by `Chris
Sneden <mailto:chris@verdi.as.utexas.edu>`_ and has -- and continues to be
-- an
invaluable contribution to modern stellar astrophysics. From the `MOOG <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_ website:

*MOOG is a code that performs a variety of LTE line analysis and spectrum
synthesis tasks. The typical use of MOOG is to assist in the determination
of the chemical composition of a star.*

The current `MOOG <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_ version
hosted by this repository is the February, 2013 version.


Installation (With Plotting)
----------------------------
Classically, MOOG has been difficult to install. Or at least, it has been
for me because I'm bad at computers. Now it's easy-ier!

If you are on a Mac then you will need to ensure you have `Xcode
<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ installed
as well as the `Command Line Tools
<http://stackoverflow.com/a/9329325/424731>`_ first. Regardless of your
operating system, you will need either `gfortran
<http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ (recommended) or `g77
<http://hpc.sourceforge.net/>`_ to compile MOOG.
If you have either of these, just open a terminal and type:

``sudo pip install moog`` (or ``sudo easy_install moog``, `if you must <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_)

And that's it. Happy spectroscopy-ing!


The installer will compile ``MOOG`` and ``MOOGSILENT`` and place them in
your ``$PATH``. It will also install the required AquaTerm framework to
``/Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/``, and create a ``~/.moog``
directory to contain data files.

**Note**: If you're on Mavericks (OS X 10.9) then SuperMongo -- and subsequently ``MOOG`` -- can be notoriously difficult to install. Consider whether you need plotting functionality or not.


Installation (Batch Mode Only)
------------------------------

If you don't need the plotting functionality in MOOG then you can install just the batch version of ``MOOG``, known as ``MOOGSILENT``:

``pip install moogsilent`` (or ``easy_install moogsilent``, `if you must <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install>`_)

If you're on OS X, you still need to ensure you have `Xcode
<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ installed
as well as the `Command Line Tools
<http://stackoverflow.com/a/9329325/424731>`_ first. Regardless of your
operating system, you will need either `gfortran
<http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ (recommended) or `g77
<http://hpc.sourceforge.net/>`_ to compile MOOG. However you do **not** need to be sudo in order to install ``MOOGSILENT``. The source code for the ``MOOGSILENT`` installer is kept in parallel on the `batch branch <https://github.com/andycasey/moog/tree/batch>`_.


Uninstall
---------
Just type the following files to uninstall MOOG:

``sudo pip uninstall moog`` (or ``pip uninstall moogsilent``)

And to clean up completely:

``sudo rm -Rf ~/.moog /Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/``
