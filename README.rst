Background
----------
`MOOG <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_ was written by `Chris
Sneden <mailto:chris@verdi.as.utexas.edu>`_ and has -- and continues to be
-- an
invaluable contribution to modern stellar astrophysics. From the `MOOG <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_ website:

*MOOG is a code that performs a variety of LTE line analysis and spectrum
synthesis tasks. The typical use of MOOG is to assist in the determination
of the chemical composition of a star.*

The current `MOOG <http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html>`_ version
hosted by this repository is the February, 2013 version.


Installation
------------
Classically, MOOG has been difficult to install. Or at least, it has been
for me because I'm bad at computers. Now it's easy-ier!

If you are on a Mac then you will need to ensure you have `Xcode
<https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ installed
as well as the `Command Line Tools
<http://stackoverflow.com/a/9329325/424731>`_ first. Regardless of your
operating system, you will need either `gfortran
<http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_ (recommended) or `g77
<http://hpc.sourceforge.net/>`_ to compile MOOG.
If you have either of these, just open a terminal and type:

``sudo pip install moog``

And that's it. Happy spectroscopy-ing!

If you don't have ``pip``, you have two options:

**1)** Install ``pip`` and try re-installing MOOG:

``sudo easy_install pip``

``sudo pip install moog``

**or**

**2)** `Download this repository
<https://github.com/andycasey/moog/archive/master.zip>`_, extract the files and type:

``sudo python setup.py install``

The installer will compile ``MOOG`` and ``MOOGSILENT`` and place them in
your ``$PATH``. It will also install the required AquaTerm framework to
``/Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/``, and create a ``~/.moog``
directory to contain data files.

Uninstall
---------
Just type the following files to uninstall MOOG:

``sudo pip uninstall moog``

And to clean up completely:

``sudo rm -Rf ~/.moog /Library/Frameworks/AquaTerm.framework/``
